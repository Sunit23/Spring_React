OVERVIEW: 
This serves as a very basic README for the sample_data_generator.py
file created to generate sample Radix data for use in SGP. This will be a
continued work in progres and the first incarnation is rought.

STRUCTURE:
Fundamentally there are two classes built to organize the data and effectively
model the outputs of Radix for use in SGP:
    1. SecurityRule: A class that encapsulates the data of a security rule
    2. ProjectCore: A class that encapsulates all the data needed for the
                    projectCore generated by Radix. This class includes various
                    helper functions to model changes to the project and add SecurityRules 
                    it
    3. SimCore: A class that encapsulates the data needed for the simCore object
                generated by Radix when a simulation is executed. This includes
                various helper functions for modeling PASS/FAIL status.

At the bottom of the file is some simple scenarios to generate JSON objects for
projectCore and simCore. This is done a random number of times based on the
specification of the variable "random_range." The JSON objects are dumped to
standard out. Currently, the following structure is followed for execution:
    1. Accumulate a random number of project revisions (projectCores)
    2. Accumulate a random number of simulations (simCores)
    3. Accumulate a random number of project revions (projectCores)
    4. Accumulate a random number of simulations (simCores)
    5. Dump all the results to standard out


This README will be updated as further additions are made.
